# Hand Gesture Volume Control

This Python script controls your system's volume using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The script detects the user's hand and adjusts the volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger. The volume is updated in real time and displayed in a UI with a volume bar.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`cv2`)
* NumPy (`numpy`)
* PulseAudio (`pulsectl`)
* Hand Tracking Module (local path required)

You can install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pulsectl
```

Additionally, you need to have a hand-tracking module. The script assumes a local path to the module, which can be added in the `sys.path.insert()` line.

## How it works

1. **Hand Detection**: The script uses a hand tracking module to detect the user's hand via the webcam. It identifies key hand landmarks and calculates the distance between the thumb and index fingers.
2. **Volume Control**: The distance between the thumb and index finger determines the volume level. The script maps this distance to a volume range (0.0 to 1.0).
3. **Interaction**: The volume is adjusted by moving your thumb and index finger apart or closer. To finalize the change, ensure that the pinky finger is not raised.
4. **UI**: The volume is represented as a bar on the screen, and the current volume percentage is displayed. The FPS (frames per second) is also shown for performance monitoring.

## How to Use

1. **Run the script**: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible by OpenCV.
2. **Adjust Volume**: Move your thumb and index fingers to adjust the volume level. The volume level is displayed both as a percentage and a bar.
3. **Exit**: Press 'q' on the keyboard to exit the application or put your middle finger down.

## Key Features

* **Real-time hand gesture recognition**: The volume is dynamically adjusted based on your hand gestures.
* **Smooth volume adjustment**: The script interpolates the distance between your fingers to achieve smooth volume control.
* **Pinky detection**: The script checks if the pinky finger is down before setting the volume, preventing accidental changes.
* **Current volume display**: Shows the current system volume in percentage.
* **FPS display**: Displays the frames per second for real-time performance feedback.

## Dependencies

* **Python 3.x**
* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`
* `pulsectl`
* Hand tracking module (local path required)
